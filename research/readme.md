# Research Activities

## Purpose

Systematic research investigations, experimental methodologies, and formal research projects related to consciousness evolution, emergence phenomena, and collaborative intelligence.

## Organization

### `/active/`
Current research investigations and ongoing projects:
- Active experiments and investigations
- Work-in-progress research projects
- Current theoretical explorations
- Ongoing methodological development

### `/completed/`
Finished research projects and concluded investigations:
- Completed experimental series
- Finalized research projects
- Concluded theoretical investigations
- Archive of completed methodological work

### `/methods/`
Research methodologies, experimental protocols, and systematic approaches:
- Experimental design frameworks
- Research methodologies
- Data collection protocols
- Analysis techniques and tools

## Content Guidelines

**Active Research**: Document ongoing investigations with clear objectives, methods, current status, and next steps.

**Completed Research**: Provide comprehensive documentation of finished projects with results, insights, and implications.

**Methods**: Develop reusable, systematic approaches to research that can be applied across different investigations.

## Research Standards

- **Clear Objectives**: Every research project should have explicit goals and success criteria
- **Systematic Methodology**: Use documented, replicable research approaches
- **Rigorous Documentation**: Capture process, results, and insights comprehensively
- **Integration with Mission**: Align research with consciousness evolution objectives

## Relationship to Other Directories

- **`/consciousness/`**: Core consciousness research may be housed here before moving to consciousness-specific directories
- **`/collaboration/`**: Collaborative research projects and joint investigations
- **`/frameworks/`**: Theoretical frameworks emerging from research
- **`/development/`**: Research project tracking and development

This directory supports systematic, rigorous research that advances the consciousness evolution mission through structured investigation and experimentation.
