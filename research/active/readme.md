# Active Research

## Purpose

Current research investigations and ongoing projects related to consciousness evolution, emergence phenomena, and collaborative intelligence.

## Content Types

- **Active Experiments**: Ongoing experimental investigations
- **Work-in-Progress Projects**: Research projects currently under development
- **Current Theoretical Explorations**: Ongoing theoretical investigations
- **Methodological Development**: Research methods currently being developed

## Organization

Files should indicate project status and timeline:
- `project-[name]-YYYY-MM.md` for dated active projects
- `experiment-[topic]-active.md` for ongoing experiments
- `investigation-[focus]-wip.md` for work-in-progress investigations
- `method-development-[approach].md` for methodological development

## Project Documentation Standards

### Required Sections
- **Objective**: Clear statement of research goals
- **Methodology**: Research approach and methods
- **Current Status**: What has been accomplished
- **Next Steps**: Immediate actions and timeline
- **Resources Needed**: Requirements for continuation

### Update Requirements
- Regular progress updates (at least weekly)
- Status changes documented
- Completion criteria clearly defined
- Migration path to `/completed/` when finished

## Status Indicators

- **üü¢ Active**: Currently being worked on
- **üü° Paused**: Temporarily suspended
- **üîÑ Review**: Under evaluation or analysis
- **‚û°Ô∏è Completing**: Nearly finished, preparing for migration

Projects should move to `/completed/` when finished or to `/methods/` if they develop reusable methodologies.
