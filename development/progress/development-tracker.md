## Long-term Vision Alignment

Core concepts remain aligned with original vision:
- Specialized AI components ✓
- Orchestration mechanisms ✓
- Natural language interfaces (pending)
- Human-AI symbiosis (pending)

The molecular framework provides a robust foundation for achieving these goals through systematic development.
