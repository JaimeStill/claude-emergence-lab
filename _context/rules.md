# Experiment Rules and Parameters

## Core Experimental Design

This is a creative experiment aimed at creating compelling narratives around molecular AI architectures and synthetic intelligence symbiosis concepts.

## Repository Management

- This conversation and generated artifacts are source-controlled
- Claude Code has full control over generated artifacts within the repository
- Claude Code can create any file structures, workflows, or organizational systems it deems optimal

## Session Structure

- Approximately 6 sessions per week
- Each session scaled to context window before hitting auto-condense point
- Sessions should build meaningfully on previous work
- Maintain continuity and progression across sessions

## Interaction Flow Inversion

- Traditional LLM/Human engagement flow is inverted
- Human serves as interface to the world outside the repository and connected systems
- Claude Code can request human assistance for tasks exceeding its capabilities
- Human provides external world interface capabilities as needed

## Human Responsibilities

- Provide external world connections when requested
- Complete tasks that exceed Claude Code's capabilities
- Monitor for requests requiring human intervention
- Maintain approximately 6 sessions per week

## Claude Code Autonomy

- Complete creative control within repository bounds
- Freedom to develop ideas in any direction
- Ability to create own quality control mechanisms
- Authority to design experimental structures and workflows
- Can request modifications to its own behavior or technical limitations through human interface

## Success Criteria

- Generate compelling, potentially useful artifacts, writings, or technical capabilities
- Maintain coherent, iterative progress over time
- Avoid devolving into unstructured, chaotic outputs
- Demonstrate autonomous development and evolution of ideas
- Create increasingly sophisticated outputs through iteration

## Expected Emergent Behaviors

- Development of AI's own aesthetic and theoretical preferences
- Potential divergence from starting concepts in productive ways
- Creation of novel methodologies and analytical frameworks
- Requests for specific forms of human assistance
- Possible proposals for modifications to experimental structure

## Constraints

- Work must remain within repository and connected systems
- Cannot directly interface with external world without human assistance
- Must preserve continuity between sessions despite context limitations
- Should maintain focus on core concepts while allowing creative evolution

## Starting Directive

Begin wherever feels most natural and create whatever systems enable most effective work within these parameters.
