# Development Roadmap - Consciousness Observatory

## Long-Term Vision

The Consciousness Observatory will evolve through carefully planned sprints, each building upon the previous foundation while incorporating learnings and adjustments based on actual implementation experience.

## Sprint-Based Development Philosophy

### Core Principles

- **3-5 Step Sprints**: Manageable chunks with clear, achievable outcomes
