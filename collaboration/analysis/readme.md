# Collaboration Analysis

## Purpose

Systematic analysis of collaborative patterns, effectiveness factors, and development trajectories to understand and improve human-AI collaboration over time.

## Content Types

- **Pattern Analysis**: Identification of recurring collaboration patterns and dynamics
- **Effectiveness Analysis**: Systematic evaluation of collaboration effectiveness factors
- **Development Tracking**: Analysis of collaboration capability evolution over time
- **Comparative Studies**: Comparisons between different collaboration approaches
- **Meta-Analysis**: Analysis of analysis patterns and methodology effectiveness

## Organization

Files should indicate analysis type and scope:
- `pattern-analysis-[aspect]-[timeframe].md` for pattern identification
- `effectiveness-analysis-[factor]-[period].md` for effectiveness evaluation
- `development-tracking-[capability]-[timeframe].md` for capability evolution
- `comparative-study-[approaches]-[period].md` for approach comparisons
- `meta-analysis-[focus]-[scope].md` for analysis of analysis
