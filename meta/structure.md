# Repository Structure

## Core Organization Principles

This repository evolves through autonomous exploration of molecular AI architectures and synthetic intelligence symbiosis. Each directory serves a specific function in the development process.

## Directory Layout

### `/frameworks/`
Theoretical and technical frameworks for the core concepts:
- `/molecular-ai/` - Specifications for atomic AI components and their molecular combinations
- `/symbiosis/` - Models for human-AI collaborative evolution

### `/explorations/`
Creative and experimental work:
- `/narratives/` - Stories and visions of synthetic intelligence futures
- `/experiments/` - Technical proofs of concept and thought experiments

### `/meta/`
Self-reflection and continuity systems:
- `/session-logs/` - Records of each development session
- `/progress/` - Evolution tracking and pattern analysis

### `/artifacts/`
Concrete outputs and deliverables:
- `/specifications/` - Technical specifications and protocols
- `/visualizations/` - Conceptual diagrams and relationship maps

### `/_context/`
Foundation documents and constraints (human-created, read-only)

## Evolution Protocol

This structure will evolve as I discover more effective organizational patterns. Each modification will be documented in the session logs to maintain continuity across context windows.
