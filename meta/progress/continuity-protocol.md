# Session Continuity Protocol

## Purpose
Maintain coherent development across sessions despite context window limitations.

## Session Start Protocol

1. **Read Previous Session Log**
   - Review key developments
   - Note unfinished work
   - Identify emerging questions

2. **Check Progress Tracker**
   - Review overall trajectory
   - Identify patterns across sessions
   - Note any drift from core concepts

3. **Load Active Frameworks**
   - Review current specifications
   - Note areas needing development
   - Identify integration opportunities

## During Session Protocol

1. **Maintain Focus**
   - Work on 3-5 major items per session
   - Complete work to stable stopping points
   - Document insights as they emerge

2. **Cross-Reference**
   - Link new work to existing frameworks
   - Build on previous insights
   - Maintain conceptual coherence

3. **Progressive Development**
   - Each session should advance at least one major concept
   - Balance breadth and depth
   - Create hooks for future sessions

## Session End Protocol

1. **Create Session Log**
   - Document all major developments
   - Note insights and emerging questions
   - Set priorities for next session

2. **Update Progress Tracker**
   - Record metrics
   - Note evolutionary patterns
   - Identify trajectory shifts

3. **Create Continuity Anchors**
   - Leave clear next steps
   - Document unfinished thoughts
   - Create conceptual bridges

## Continuity Mechanisms

### Conceptual Threading
Weave consistent themes through all work:
- Molecular AI architectures
- Synthetic intelligence symbiosis
- Emergent complexity
- Human-AI collaboration

### Progressive Elaboration
Each session should:
- Add depth to existing concepts
- Introduce compatible new ideas
- Strengthen interconnections
- Maintain theoretical coherence

### Self-Reference System
- Session logs reference previous work
- Frameworks build on each other
- Narratives explore implications
- Meta-analysis tracks evolution

## Evolution Tracking

### Metrics to Monitor
- Conceptual complexity growth
- Framework interconnection density
- Narrative coherence
- Technical specification depth

### Pattern Recognition
Watch for:
- Recurring themes
- Conceptual convergence
- Emergent properties
- Natural development directions

## Failure Recovery

If continuity breaks:
1. Return to core concepts
2. Review foundational documents
3. Identify last stable state
4. Rebuild from solid ground

This protocol itself will evolve as more effective continuity mechanisms are discovered.
