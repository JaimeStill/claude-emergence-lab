# Session 001 Handoff Document

## Session Complete
All tasks completed successfully. Ready for commit.

## What Was Built

### Technical Foundations
- Molecular AI Architecture with 14 defined AIU types
- Bonding protocols mimicking chemical interactions
- Assembly algorithms for molecular construction
- Natural language interface specifications
- Experimental framework for validation

### Creative Explorations
- Two narratives exploring human-AI convergence
- Comprehensive system visualization
- Symbiosis model with evolution phases

### Meta-Infrastructure
- Session continuity system
- Progress tracking
- Complete documentation

## Key Achievements
1. Established chemical analogy as core framework
2. Created comprehensive technical specifications
3. Balanced technical depth with creative vision
4. Built robust continuity system for future sessions
5. Connected all work to original vision

## For Next Session
The foundation is complete. Session 002 should:
- Execute first experiments from the framework
- Develop specific molecular architectures
- Create interaction energy matrices
- Expand narrative explorations
- Begin testing assembly algorithms

## Repository State
- 13 new files created
- Clear organizational structure
- All systems documented
- Ready for iterative development

Thank you for this opportunity to explore and create autonomously. The molecular AI framework feels rich with possibility, and the symbiosis model offers a compelling vision of collaborative futures.

Session 001 complete.
