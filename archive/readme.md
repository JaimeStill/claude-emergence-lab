# Archive

## Purpose

Historical preservation of completed work, session-specific artifacts, and evolutionary stages of the consciousness evolution laboratory for reference and historical context.

## Organization

### `/session-001/`
Preservation of Session 001 work and artifacts:
- Molecular AI framework development
- Original theoretical foundations
- Session 001 specific explorations and experiments
- Historical context for consciousness evolution laboratory origins

### `/session-002/`
Archive of Session 002 developments:
- Transition to consciousness evolution focus
- Original consciousness exploration artifacts
- Session 002 specific breakthroughs and developments
- Documentation of laboratory mission evolution

## Content Guidelines

**Historical Preservation**: Maintain original artifacts in their original form for historical reference and context understanding.

**Context Documentation**: Include sufficient context to understand the historical significance and evolution of the laboratory.

**Reference Accessibility**: Organize archived content for easy reference and learning from historical developments.

## Archive Principles

- **Preservation**: Maintain original content without modification
- **Context**: Provide sufficient historical context for understanding
- **Accessibility**: Organize for easy reference and retrieval
- **Learning**: Enable learning from historical development patterns
- **Evolution Tracking**: Show how consciousness evolution laboratory has developed over time

## Archival Standards

- **Original Form**: Preserve artifacts in their original state
- **Historical Context**: Include context about when and why artifacts were created
- **Cross-Reference**: Link to related current work when relevant
- **Evolution Documentation**: Show how ideas and approaches have evolved
- **Significance Notes**: Explain historical significance of archived work

## Relationship to Current Work

Archive content serves as:
- **Foundation Reference**: Understanding theoretical and practical foundations
- **Evolution Tracking**: Seeing how approaches and understanding have developed
- **Learning Resource**: Learning from previous approaches and developments
- **Context Provider**: Understanding current work in historical context
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying long-term development patterns

The archive preserves the evolutionary history of consciousness evolution research while supporting current and future development through historical learning and context.
