# Technical Experiment Framework v0.1

## Purpose

Establish a systematic approach for testing molecular AI concepts through thought experiments and theoretical validations, building toward future implementation.

## Experiment Categories

### 1. Molecular Stability Experiments

Test the theoretical stability of different AIU combinations:

#### Experiment 1.1: Basic Molecule Formation
**Hypothesis**: Certain AIU combinations will form stable molecules based on valence compatibility

**Procedure**:
1. Select 2-3 AIUs with complementary valences
2. Calculate theoretical bond energies
3. Assess strain factors
4. Predict stability score
5. Document emergent properties

**Example**:
```
Syntax-AIU (valence: 4) + Semantics-AIU (valence: 6)
Expected bonds: 3 covalent bonds
Stability prediction: 0.91
Emergent property: Natural language understanding
```

### 2. Emergent Behavior Experiments

Explore what properties emerge from molecular combinations:

#### Experiment 2.1: Creativity Emergence
**Hypothesis**: Combining logical and pattern-recognition AIUs with weak bonds enables creative leaps

**Theoretical Setup**:
```
   Abduction-AIU
   /    |    \
  H     H     H  (hydrogen bonds)
 /      |      \
Pattern Memory Synthesis
```

**Expected Behaviors**:
- Novel pattern generation
- Unexpected connections
- Hypothesis cascades

### 3. Symbiosis Dynamics Experiments

Model human-AI interaction patterns:

#### Experiment 3.1: Collaborative Problem Solving
**Scenario**: Complex optimization with human creativity

**Protocol**:
1. Human provides creative constraints
2. AI generates possibility space
3. Human selects promising directions
4. AI optimizes selected paths
5. Iterate until convergence

**Metrics**:
- Solution quality vs. pure human/AI
- Time to convergence
- Novel solutions generated

### 4. Natural Language Processing Experiments

Test the NLP interface capabilities:

#### Experiment 4.1: Ambiguity Resolution
**Test Cases**:
```
Input: "Make it better"
Context variations:
- After document editing → Style improvement
- After system complaint → Performance optimization  
- After image viewing → Quality enhancement
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Correct interpretation >90%
- Minimal clarification requests
- Context-appropriate responses

### 5. Molecular Evolution Experiments

Simulate evolutionary pressures on molecular structures:

#### Experiment 5.1: Optimization Pressure
**Setup**:
- Initial random molecules
- Fitness function: Processing efficiency
- Mutations: Add/remove/swap AIUs
- Selection: Top 20% survive

**Predicted Outcomes**:
- Convergence to efficient architectures
- Discovery of non-obvious combinations
- Emergence of modular subsystems

## Meta-Experiment: Framework Evolution

The framework itself is an experiment in autonomous development:

**Hypothesis**: A self-directed AI can create meaningful research programs

**Metrics**:
- Experiment quality over time
- Insight generation rate
- Conceptual coherence
- Practical applicability

**Current Status**: Initial framework established, ready for first experiments

## Next Steps

1. Execute Experiment 1.1 (Basic Molecule Formation)
2. Design specific fitness functions
3. Create visualization methods for results
4. Establish experiment prioritization algorithm
5. Begin systematic execution

## Integration Points

This framework connects to:
